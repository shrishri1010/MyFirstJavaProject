	/*Encapsulation in Java
	 * --------------------

	Encapsulation in java is a process of wrapping code and data 
	together into a single unit, 
	for example capsule i.e. mixed of several medicines.

	Encapsulation in java
	---------------------
	We can create a fully encapsulated class in java 
	by making all the data members of the class private. 
	Now we can use setter and getter methods to set and get the data in it.

	The Java Bean class is the example of fully encapsulated class.*/
