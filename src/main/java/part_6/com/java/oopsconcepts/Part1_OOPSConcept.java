	//OOP's Concepts in JAVA
	//------------------------
	//1.Object
	//2.Class
	//3.Abstraction
	//4.Encapsulation
	//5.Inheritance
	//6.Polymorphism
	
	/*Object:--- Object is an instance(example) of a class.

	Any entity that has State and behavior is known as an object. 
	For example: chair, pen, table, keyboard, bike etc. 
	Object can be physical entity 
	
	State:- represents data (value) of an object.
	Behavior: represents the behavior (functionality) of an object 
	such as Deposit, Withdraw etc.
	*/
	
	/*Class:-
	  class is a group of objects which have common properties. 
	  It is a template or blueprint from which objects are created. 
	  It is a logical entity. It can't be physical.
	  
	  A class in Java can contain:

		1.Fields OR Instance variable OR State
		2.Methods OR Behaviour
		3.Constructors
		4.blocks
		
		Syntax to declare a class:-
		-------------------------
		class <class_name>{  
		    field//Instance variable;  
		    method;  
		}
		
		Instance variable in Java
		-------------------------
			A variable which is created inside the class 
			but outside the method, 
			is known as instance variable. 
			Instance variable doesn't get memory 
			at compile time. 
			It gets memory at run time when object(instance) is created. 
			That is why, it is known as instance variable. 
		
		Method in Java
		-----------------
		In java, a method is like function 
		i.e. used to expose behavior of an object.

		Advantage of Method
		-------------------
		Code Reusability
		
		new keyword in Java
		-------------------
		The new keyword is used to allocate memory at run time. 
		All objects get memory in Heap memory area.

	/*3 Ways to initialize objects:-
	  * --------------------------

		There are 3 ways to initialize object in java.

	    1.By reference variable
	    2.By method
	    3.By constructor*/
