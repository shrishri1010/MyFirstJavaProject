	is known as abstract class in java. 
	It can have abstract and non-abstract methods 
	(method with body).
	It needs to be extended and its method implemented. 
	It cannot be instantiated.
	
	Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details 
	and showing only functionality to the user.*/
	
	/*Abstraction in Java
	---------------------
	Another way, it shows only important things to the 
	user and hides the internal details 
	for example sending sms, you just type the 
	text and send the message. 
	You don't know the internal processing about the message delivery.
